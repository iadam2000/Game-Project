Narrator: ---A red cross flashes across the device's screen, and the five empty boxes appear again.
Agent Furcifer: ---There you are. I knew you were around here somewhere. Now, I'll be taking that.
Narrator: ---Agent Furcifer reaches down and snatches the completed device from your hands. ---You try to yank it away, but they are too fast.
Agent Furcifer: ---Ahh, the Sidrat! Long have we searched for you. ---And here you are, finally in our grasp.
Narrator: ---You charge at agent Furcifer, intent on retaking the device, but agent Furcifer---steps aside and trips you, sending you sprawling in the dirt.
Agent Furcifer: ---I have half a mind to take you back to the present if only to witness ---the new world which we will bring about with this... this most beauteous artefact! But no... ---You have been a thorn in my side for too long.
Narrator: ---Agent Furcifer reaches inside his suit with one hand. Your eyes widen as you ---realise what's about to happen. You launch yourself at your enemy once again, but Furcifer ---kicks you back into the ground.
Agent Furcifer: ---I shall not mourn leaving you here. Although, if it is some solace to you, ---know that your sacrifice was necessary for the betterment of all mankind.
Narrator: ---Then, they're gone. You are alone in this shattered wasteland of stone. Having risen ---to your feet, you slump back to your knees.
Narrator: ---This is it.
Narrator: ---You are doomed.
Narrator: ---This is...
Narrator: ---The end.
